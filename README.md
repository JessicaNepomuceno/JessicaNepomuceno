With over three years of experience in the development and maintenance of legacy systems, I have a proven track record of delivering robust and efficient solutions that support critical corporate functions.

I began my career in IT as a technical support specialist, where I gained a solid foundation in maintaining technological infrastructure. This initial experience allowed me to develop essential skills in preventive and corrective maintenance, ensuring the high performance and reliability of systems.

In my current role, I develop and maintain essential systems that provide critical functionalities, such as analytical reports and registration forms, always adhering to best practices in development and clean code. My significant contributions include the analysis, optimization, and creation of queries, procedures, and triggers that ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of business information. I utilize Agile methodologies, such as Scrum, and version control tools like TFS, Azure DevOps, and Git to ensure continuous and high-quality delivery.

My technical skills include the use of Oracle Server, JavaScript, Git, RabbitMQ, API REST, Object Oriented Language C#, Entity Framework, Bootstrap, Object-Oriented Developer, Azure DevOps, HTML, CSS, .NET Framework, JQuery, TypeScript, SQL Server, TFS.
